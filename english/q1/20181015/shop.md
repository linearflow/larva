I've chosen to talk about GS25, which is a convenience store near to my flat that I always go to.

There is a standard convenience store, which means it sells lots of products necessities such as drink, food as like the processed food. They are also able to charge a transport card, so you can use public transport. In fact, I always charge the card for using public transport. And there is a microwave to heat up the instant food when I buy it. Also, you can eat it there.

This shop is well-organized. I mean there's a lot of products there. If you want to find a product,  you can find your own easily. And there is a big window in the front. It makes a bright atmosphere in the shop. And at the back, there is a seating area, kind of like a bar, where can heat your food and eat it.

The shop is on the opposite my apartment block, so I can just take the elevator down and cross the street from my flat. All of the resident in my flat use there. 

There are plant reasons I use the store. First of all, It is very convenient, I mean there is so close to my flat. Secondly, they always sales a kind of beers After work when I go back my home, I tend to buy some beer and food to enjoy my free time.
