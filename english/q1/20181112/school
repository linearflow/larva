Did you go to secondary/high school near to where you lived [Why/Why not?]
No, my high school was not close to my house. I always took a bus to my high school for 40 minutes. I mean I was a student in a vocational high school. I did want to learn technical study in computer science. So I applied to the school even though another regular high school was nearby. os that's probably why...

What did you like about your secondary/high school? [why?]
Well, I had an excellent curriculum in my major, what I was really motivating and inspiring to get computer skills such as programming and web design.
Ans also there were lots of extracurricular activities to support it. I mean lots of after-school clubs as like programming club and design club. So it helped me to improve my skills.

Tell me about anything you didn't like at your school.
Hum... There was nothing I particularly disliked about school. But one thing I did like some teachers. I mean stern or strict teachers who don't understand student aiming. And there were students,  bullied other students.  But I think It's probably the same everywhere

How do you think your school could be improved? [Why/Why not?]
I guess they could teach foreign languages like English. I mean I was a student at a vocational high school. the school focused on obtaining a job and going to technical colleagues. If they taught foreign languages, it helped students to adapt a new environment such as a job or a colleague because English skill is required by there in my major.
